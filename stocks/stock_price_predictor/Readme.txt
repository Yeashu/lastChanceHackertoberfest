Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

Project Description
This is a Stock Price Prediction model that predicts future stock prices using machine learning techniques.

Key Features:
- Utilizes a stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to capture the sequential nature of stock prices.
- Data is normalized using Min-Max scaling to enhance model performance.
- Includes Moving Average and Rolling Mean for trend detection and noise reduction in stock prices.
- The application's performance is measured by Mean Square Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), ensuring precise prediction evaluations.

Technology Justification:
The choice of a stacked LSTM model allows for effective learning from past price sequences, crucial for time-series data like stock prices.
