# Last Chance Hacktoberfest 2024 🎃🍁

Welcome to **Last Chance Hacktoberfest 2024**! 🎉 This repository was created for those who still want to participate in Hacktoberfest 2024 and contribute with exciting tasks in the areas of **stocks**, **graphs**, and **data analytics**. 🚀

## 🏆 Objectives

Hacktoberfest is a celebration of open source during the month of October. We aim to encourage and empower developers of all levels to contribute and learn through practical and fun tasks. Here you will have the chance to:

- **Contribute to ongoing projects**
- **Learn valuable skills** such as data visualization, automation, and data manipulation
- **Receive feedback** to improve your coding skills

## 🗂 Repository Structure

This repository is divided into three main categories:

1. **Stocks**
    - Contribute to tasks related to process automation, API integrations, or market analysis involving stocks and financial data.
    - **Suggested tasks**: Automating stock market data collection, API integrations with stock exchanges, creating real-time stock dashboards.

2. **Graphs**
    - Create or improve data visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib, Plotly, or D3.js.
    - **Suggested tasks**: Build interactive graphs, dashboards, or time series visualizations.

3. **Analytics**
    - Provide scripts or notebooks for data analysis using Python (Pandas, NumPy) or R.
    - **Suggested tasks**: Exploratory data analysis, building predictive models, data cleaning and transformation.

Each contribution should be made within its respective directory:
- `stocks/` for stock-related contributions
- `graphs/` for graphical or data visualization tasks
- `analytics/` for data analysis tasks

For each contribution, create a **sub-directory** within the appropriate folder and include your code there, along with a `README.md` file that explains what the contribution does, how to use it, and any necessary setup instructions.

### Example Structure:
/stocks/my-stock-analysis/

my_stock_analysis.py
README.md

/graphs/interactive-graph-visualization/

graph_visualization.py
README.md

/analytics/data-analysis-on-customer-dataset/
